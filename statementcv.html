		<h2>ARTIST STATEMENT</h2>
			<p>the forms i work with are inspired by the internal and external anatomy of insects and animals. i incorporate my love of nature with the distortion and simplification found in 20th century abstract art and modern digital art. the softness of a digital brush, the otherworldliness of low-poly renders, and the crackling of a compressed image all work within the same balanced chaos of the natural world. mutation and cyclical relationships are key aspects of both and my work reflects that.</p>
			<p>though i work in abstract sculpture, it is essential that my work does not alienate an audience.  many of my pieces are built to live beyond the gallery, as i understand the “white cube” to be a place of tension and hierarchy. i’ve also taken to making my own plinths or otherwise opting for the floor.</p>
			<p>common themes i address in my work are environmentalism, mental health, gender and sexuality, and disability.  as a Mad non-binary person i often feel i have to explain my identity before i am taken seriously. though i may touch on it, my work is first and foremost a denial of sanity and cisnormativity. i, like other marginalized people, feel no need to justify what i am to comfort others.</p>
			<p>a large part of my work is experimenting with different glazing techniques and recipes. i get satisfaction from the more precise chemical work of glaze mixing and the mystery of it’s outcomes. my recent work uses experiments with unconventional non-ceramic materials, including building materials such as metal, industrial spray foam, wood, and spackling paste. i find having these points of reference immediately connects the audience to a piece.</p>
			<p>through my work i give complex and muddled ideas the complex and muddled form they 	deserve. i aim to be a jumping off point for conversation. when people see my work, my goal is for them to leave more curious and hopefully, more knowledgeable.</p>
