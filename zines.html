	<h1>ECUAD DONOR MAP: MAPPING EAST VAN (2020) w/ MICKEY MORGAN</h1>
	<br>
		<p>a collab with mickey morgan at <a href="https://mappingeastvan.wixsite.com/home" target="_blank">mapping east van</a> to create a set of posters and a zine that reflect on emily carr university and the surrounding land. in this project, we asked ourselves how this new campus was created, who/what paid for it, what our being-here serves, and what was here before.
		<p>the zine, which focuses on the emily carr campus and it's donors, was written and designed by mickey morgan. the poster, which focuses on the gentrification of the false creek flats and the development "south flatz", was written and designed by myself. both were created under an attribution-sharealike cc by-sa license.</p>
		<p>both the posters and zine include a qr code to a resources/sources document, where you can find where we got our information and a list of organizations in so-called vancouver and the downtown eastside to support.</p>
